    "p1":
      "Aspiring Front End Engineer, with Full Stack capabilities. I have prior experience on a Front End development team, as a Systems Analyst, at a Financial Institution. Following that, I transitioned to a customer facing role, as an Integration Manager, at an Education Technology company.",
    "p2":
      "I coordinated with software integration teams from publishers and for-profit institutions. I instructed teams over the usage of the companyâ€™s APIs and workflows for product models. This piqued my interest into understanding how APIs are built. With this and a desire to be back on the development side, I found myself going down the engineering route.",
    "p3":
      "I am currently based in Raleigh, NC. Other interests of mine outside of development are: attending  music concerts and festivals, over anaylzying my favorite soccer team (Liverpool FC), and powerlifting."
